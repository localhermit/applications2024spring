    <h1>User Story Analaysis</h1>
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_V-Rp4lgSBki_Ha-fIV19oR2B3D9M2OKNlwcJ4BVMk/edit?usp=sharing">google sheet</a>
    <p>
        Each user story is categorized by action and goal- what is the goal of the user and what action do they need to do. In addition, the user stories are scored based on the priority of the action/goal to the user, how common the needs were, and how achievable were each goal on a scale of 1-3 (3- very important and 1- not very important). The mean of the three scores were taken to determine the importance of each user story. 
    </p>
    <p>I then created 4 graphs
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Graph 1:</strong> each persona to goal category to find out which was the most important to each persona.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Graph 2:</strong> which goal was scored the highest amongst all the personas
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Graph 3:</strong> each persona to action category to find out which was the most important to each persona.
       
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Graph 4:</strong> which action was scored the highest amongst all the personas</p>
