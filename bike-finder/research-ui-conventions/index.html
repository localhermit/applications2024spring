    <h2>Alienware Laptop</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Filters:</strong>
            <p>
                This element has been used by other sites/apps when there are a lot of variations or options for the user to choose from.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was intuitive to use because there was a subtitle saying "Filters". Additionally, it is also a very common element seen on a lot of sites/apps, so for those who have been on the internet for a while it is easy to know how to use the element.
            </p>

            <p>
               The element is designed to help user narrow down their search to their preferences. It's to weed out anything that doesn't fit their requirement.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was used to let users to filter in what components they were looking for in a laptop. It's successful because it allow users to narrow down what laptop they would want based on what they're looking for in a laptop.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sort By</strong>
            <p>
               This a common element used when there is a long list of objects. 
            </p>

            <p>
               I did know how to operate this element because a lot of sites/apps have it.
            </p>

            <p>
               It allow the user to view products in order base on relevancy, price, rating, etc. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It is used to allow users to choose what order they want to view the products in. It successfully allow users to dissect information faster.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Customize</strong>
            <p>
                I have seen similar feature to this element usually on ecommerce site/apps that are selling products with a lot of specs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I did because the button says "customize" which indicates what I'll be doing when I click on it.
            </p>

            <p>
                It lets users to customize their laptop specs base on their personal perferences.
            </p>

            <p>
                It gives users more authoritiy to tailor their laptop to their taste. It is successful because a user could be too lazy to look for a laptop that matches their taste and could just customize it themselves.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Financing offers</strong>
            <p>
               I've seen something similar with airline websites and Amazon. Usually on sites that have a credit card line and are trying to promote it to their users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes because it has key highlights written out before I click learn more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Laptops are expensive, so there is a lot of monetary aspects a user will need to consider.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a promotional element. It is promoting their special offerings for those who open a Dell Pay Credit.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Frito Lay Chips</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>
            <strong>Drop Downs</strong>
            <p>
                I've seen this element a lot in filters or product page when there are additional information/details.
            </p>

            <p>
                Common element used to hide additional information, so site doesn't look too crowded.
            </p>

            <p>
               Make the site look more clean and less crowded.
            </p>

            <p>
                Its to hide the long list of check box for the filter. It does a good job making the filter look less daunting and keeps the site looking clean.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>add and subtract quantity</strong>
            <p>
                A lot of ecommerce site has them. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes because it has '-' signs and '+' signs to indicate add or subtract quantity.
            </p>

            <p>
               Let's user choose how many items they want.
            </p>

            <p>
               It was used so that users can choose how many bags of chips they want. It is successful as it does the job.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>About the Brand</strong>
            <p>
               I usually sees this in the about page for the website. I haven't seen any on the product page before.
            </p>

            <p>
               Yes because it has a title that tells me what to expect what it'll be talking about.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is giving more information about the brand of chips being bought.
            </p>

            <p>
                It doesn't really do much. It doesn't tell me how this brand is different from the other brand of chips.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recipe</strong>
            <p>
                Some food/produce website would have recipe articles as additional content to provide more value to customers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes due to the image. From the title alone it can be misleading. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It provides more content/value to the customer when deciding what chips to purchase.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was used to show food that the chips can be made into. Successfully providing more reasons as to why they should purchase that brand of chips.
