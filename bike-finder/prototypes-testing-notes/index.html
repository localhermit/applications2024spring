<body>
    <h2>Person 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
           the frame could end earlier (lots of white space at the end)
        </li>
        <li>
            margins and spacing are all aligned and similar (nice)
        </li>
        <li>
            quiz questions make sense, ordering make sense (doesn't feel too strongly about anything)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Person 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            border or separation for footer could help it separate/distinguish itself from the rest of the website
        </li>
        <li>
            the quiz image would be nice to have it fill up the entire screen (the white strips on the top and bottom might make it look off)
        </li>
        <li>
            have a little circle outline around the current color selection
        </li>
        <li>
            hover over categories (make it more transparent? darker?)
        </li>
        <li>
            compare toggle is a little long (text looks really small in comparison)
        </li>
        <li>
            make the bike image smaller (cause it touching the edge makes it look unintentional)
        </li>
        <li>
            boarder around current image (in image carousel)
        </li>
        <li>
            product page: add current state to indicate what bike the user would be getting when adding to bag
        </li>
        <li>
            metric drop down for height/shin length
        </li>
        <li>
           a metric bar would be nice for the quiz
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Person 3</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>
            add other categories so it noticeable that its horizontal scroll
        </li>
        <li>
            quiz: age can be like a drop down/+ - quantity button
        </li>
        <li>
            quiz: include in/cm
        </li>
        <li>
            quiz: the section page aren't very necessary
        </li>
        <li>
            quiz: how often you would be riding? ask for adult or kid
        </li>
        <li>
            quiz: ranking page should look different
        </li>
        <li>
            indicate the current bike status so user knows what bike to get
        </li>
        <li>
            include a view of questions bc u have add question button
        </li>
        
    </ul>
