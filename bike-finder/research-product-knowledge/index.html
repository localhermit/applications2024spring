    <h2>Physical Product + Product Variations</h2>

    <h3>Types and Styles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mountain Bike: off road/trail riding. They generally have suspension either front or full and wide, grippy
            tyres
        </li>
        <li>
            Hybrid Bike: built on a spectrum with some much closer to road bikes and others much closer to mountain
            bikes (can take on different situations) -> good for City riders,
            Commuting,
            People who take on a mix of terrain,
            Riding with the family,
            A runaround to take to the shops etc. (They are normally the cheapest type of bike), and
            Touring.

        </li>
        <li>
            The Basics: quick progress on the roads with the least effort possible (road riding, touring ,communiting)
        </li>

        <li>
            Electric: have an inbuilt motor which can be recharged to give the rider an extra boost (used in cities and
            will make hilly areas less daunting to inexperienced riders)
        </li>

        <li>
            City: designed for short urban rides
        </li>

        <li>
            Folding: designed for commuting and are often used by people travelling by train (ideal for short journeys)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Steel: Ideal for touring,
            Good for heavier riders as it is generally a very strong material
        </li>
        <li>
            Aluminium: Less prone to rust making it a good touring or winter bike option.
            Stiffness means great power transfer through the frame.
            At the lower end of the price scale.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carbon Fibre: Light but still incredibly strong.
            Aerodynamic frame shapes.
            A carbon frame can last a lifetime if well maintained.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frame Size</h3>
    <p>Most bike manufacturers have size charts that list frame size based on height</p>

    <h3>Components + Specs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gears: a low enough bottom gear to get you up the hills and a high enough top gear to allow you to reach the
            speeds you desire without your legs having to spin too fast or none
        </li>
        <li>
            Brakes: rim brakes (traditional) and disc brakes (like motorcycle -> on road and mountain bikes)
        </li>
        <li>
            Wheel: choice is largely a matter of performance nuances
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buying Experience</h2>

    <h3> Local Bike Shops: close enough to you that you can use again and again for bikes, parts, repairs, clothing and
        even just advice</h3>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            get face to face advice
        </li>
        <li>
            can try and negotiate on the price (ex: get some accessories thrown in or a free service)
        </li>
        <li>
            can be measured up and find a bike that fits
        </li>
        <li>
            will often complete a basic bike setup like getting the saddle and handlebars in the right position
        </li>
        <li>
            often they will offer a follow up service after a period of time. Cables stretch, brakes pads rub, spokes
            loosen. Bikes take a time to settle down so having someone around to do a routine follow up can be really
            useful
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            choice is significantly less than online
        </li>
        <li>
            Price is often higher as shops have overheads such as rent and labour
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Online: convenience of getting a bike to front door</h3>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            can shop around multiple retailers to find the exact bike
        </li>
        <li>
            Some bikes are exclusively available through online retailers
        </li>
        <li>
            can often see reviews from other customers of the bikes
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            going to have to assemble the bike
        </li>
        <li>
            have to set up saddle height and similar measurement-based aspects
        </li>
        <li>
            unlikely to get any kind of service deal thrown in so this will be an additional cost in the first few months
        </li>
        <li>
            won’t be able to have a test ride so size / fit may be an issue 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Second Hand: can save a lot of money but you also run a much higher risk as it is highly unlikely to have any
        form of guarantee or returns policy</h3>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            a much lower price -> saves a lot of money
        </li>
        <li>
            likely to be less depreciation after purchase than on a new bike
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            don’t know entirely what you’re getting, especially if you haven’t viewed it beforehand
        </li>
        <li>
            an take time to find the right bike in the right size
        </li>
        <li>
            can end up with stolen or ‘fake’ bikes (scammed)
        </li>
        <li>
            Sometimes the price may not lead to long term value
        </li>
    </ul>
